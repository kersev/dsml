Exercise 3: Scientific notation with regards to numbers

You may have noticed R providing numbers that are formatted similar to
the following. This is called scientific notation.

e.g. 2.78e7

e.g. 3.89e-7

So when you see the letter \'e\' in a number, please take notice that
this number is being presented using scientific notation and usually
means that the real number is either likely very small or very large.

If the number [after]{.underline} the \'e\' letter is a negative number
(e.g. e-07 or e-7, i.e. notice the minus (-) symbol), then you know that
the real number is likely small.

If the number [after]{.underline} the \'e\' letter is a positive number
(e.g. e07 or e7), then you know that the real number is likely large.

For example,

the number 2.78e7 is equivalent to 2.78 × 10\^7

Note: 10\^7 is read as 10 to power of 7.

With 2.78 × 10\^7 you can work out what the actual number is, which is:

27800000

You may also notice that we can take the number 2.78 and move the
decimal point to the right 7 times to get the real number (27800000).

Here is another example where there is a negative number after the
letter \'e\'.

3.89e-7

3.89e-7 is is equivalent to 3.89 \* 10\^-7

With 3.89 \* 10\^-7 you can calculate the actual number, which is:

0.000000389

You may also have noticed the 7 zeros in the number.

Read the following and use the following calculator to explore
converting very small and very large numbers to numbers presented using
scientific notation and explore converting numbers in scientific
notation to real numbers etc.:

This is really important as you may see R presenting results using
scientific notation and for example, R may, at times, present p-values
as numbers in scientific notation (likely when the p-value is very
small).
