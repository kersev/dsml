**Law of large numbers exercise:**

The law of large numbers could be described as the fact that as the
sample size/dataset gets larger, its sample mean and sample SD moves
closer to the population mean and SD. In other words, larger sample
sizes are typically more representative of the population.

-   **Write the following code into R studio:**

> population \<- rnorm(1000, 52, 40)
>
> samplemeans \<- vector(length=100)
>
> sampleSDs \<- vector(length=100)
>
> for(i in 1:100){
>
> y \<- sample(population, i\*10)
>
> samplemeans\[i\] \<- mean(y)
>
> sampleSDs\[i\] \<- sd(y)
>
> }

-   **Spend time understanding this code.**

**Here is a start:**

This *population* variable stores a vector of 1000 numbers randomly
sampled from a population distribution where the population mean is 52
and the population standard deviation (SD) is 40. For example, this
could be the population of all exam scores.

*The samplemeans* vector stores a series of sample means -- where each
sample mean is from a different sample size.

-   **Now try to explain each line in the code yourself. Write in your
    own code comments for your own record.**

-   **Plot the following, and notice how the sample mean is more akin to
    the population mean as the sample size increases**

plot(samplemeans)

abline(h=52)

-   **Plot the following and notice how the sample SD is more akin to
    the population SD as the sample size increases**

plot(sampleSDs)

abline(h=40)

![](media/image2.jpeg){width="3.8055555555555554in"
height="2.6979166666666665in"}

-   **Time permitting, have some fun playing with the simulator (code)
    and change the parameters etc., for example the population
    statistics. And note down your observations.**
