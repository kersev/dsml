### How much data do we create?

“328.77 million terabytes per day”

*90% of data was created in the last 2 years** 
[**https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day**](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day)

### ‘Big Data’

- Volume
- Velocity
- Variety
- Veracity

Do you have big data? Really?

It might look big, but you may not have enough rows to provide sufficient variance given the number of variables. Consider 20 Boolean variables – how many rows would you need to represent the possible number of permutations?

$$2^{20} = 1,048,576$$

### Do I have enough data for my project?

Depends: could be based on the number of variables/features, number of outputs/classes…

1 in 10 rule…. for regression?

1000 lecimages/images for each class… for computer vision?

[https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-you-know-you-have-enough-training-data-ad9b1fd679ee](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-do-you-know-you-have-enough-training-data-ad9b1fd679ee)

[https://petewarden.com/2017/12/14/how-many-lecimages/images-do-you-need-to-train-a-neural-network/](https://petewarden.com/2017/12/14/how-many-lecimages/images-do-you-need-to-train-a-neural-network/)

The "one in ten rule" in statistics is a simple guideline for regression analysis that helps prevent overfitting. It states:

For every predictive variable (feature) you want to include in your model, you should have at least 10 events in your data.

For example:

- In logistic regression, if your less common outcome occurs 30 times, you should use no more than 3 predictive variables
- In survival analysis, if you have 50 uncensored events (like deaths), you should limit yourself to 5 predictors

If you violate this rule by including too many variables, your model may fit your current data well but will likely perform poorly on new data because it's capturing random noise rather than true relationships.

This rule is often violated in fields like genomics where researchers might analyze thousands of genes with relatively few patients, leading to questionable findings.

## Case Study - Ulster research Application: Helpline caller analytics

**Caller Characteristics/features:**

1. Number of calls
2. Mean call duration
3. Standard deviation of call durations

**4 Steps: Data Preparation for Clustering analysis**:

1. Derived a new data set: **61,287 callers**/61,287 rows with these 3 features
2. Feature standardisation (important that each feature is metric agnostic so there is no bias)
3. Choose k
4. Apply the K-means clustering technique

### Open data

- Free to the world to download
- Provides analysis at scale
- Caveat is that
    - It can dominate data science projects
    - Data can be ‘overanalysed’
    - What about data provenance?
    - What about data quality?

**Also having open data does not necessarily mean that it is easily accessible data!**

## Problem with health data science

> *"It’s easy to let ourselves be driven by what we can do with the data, rather than by the most pressing clinical need. We see many AI solutions addressing the same tasks, because those are the tasks for which the data are available."*

# Introduction to R

## Resources

- BOOK: The Art of R Programming
- http://www.statmethods.net

## What is R and its history?

- Statistical computing
- Developed by John Chambers at Bell Labs

SPSS vs. R

R vs. Python

## Computer Programming Paradigms

- Procedural Programming
- Object Oriented Programming
- **Functional Programming**

> *“Functional Programming is when functions …are used as the fundamental building blocks of a program.”*
> 

c2.com/cgi/wiki?FunctionalProgramming

## RAM needed

- CSV file with 1,500,000 rows and 120 columns, each cell being a number.
    
    ![lecimages/image.png](lecimages/image%204.png)
    

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)

- Some people use R for only it’s built in functions

```r
x <- c(1,5,3)
mean(x)
```

- Some people program custom functions

```r
f <- function(a, b) {
	y <- a*b
	return(y)
}
f(2,3)
```

## R has 5 basic or “atomic” classes of objects (modes)

1. character
2. numeric
3. integer
4. complex
5. logical (True/False)

### The most basic object is a vector

- A vector can only contain objects of the same class/mode
- The one exception is a *list*, which is represented as a vector but can contain objects of different classes
- Empty vectors can be created with the `vector()` function.

### Vectors

```r
x <- c(0.5, 0.6) ## numeric
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE) ## logical
x <- c(T, F) ## logical
x <- c("a", "b", "c") ## character
x <- c(1,2,3) ## integer
x <- c(1+0i, 2+4i) ## complex
```

### THE **:** OPERATOR

```r
x <- c(1:20)
```

```r
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20)
```

### Vector() method

```r
y <- vector(length=2)
```

```r
y[1] <- 3
y[2] <- 8
```

> Note: vectors are not 0 based
>
