**Confusion matrix tutorial**

A confusion matrix is often used to show the performance of a diagnostic
tool or a machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithm is
typically a binary classification algorithm. For example, in healthcare,
the algorithm could output if the patient has a disease or does not have
the disease (hence binary -- having one of two outcomes).

Suppose you developed a logistic regression algorithm to classify if a
patient has a disease or does not. After testing the algorithm on a test
set, you get the following confusion matrix:

Use the reference confusion matrix enclosed to answer the following
questions and calculate the metrics:

A)  How many true positives are displayed in the confusion matrix?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

B)  How many true negatives are displayed in the confusion matrix?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

C)  What is the overall accuracy of the algorithm?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

D)  What is the sensitivity of the algorithm?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

E)  What is the specificity of the algorithm?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

F)  What is the F1 score?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

G)  How many type 1 errors are made?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Note: Accuracy is not a good measure of performance as it is influenced
by the % of disease prevalence whereas sensitivity and specificity are
not dependent on disease prevalence.
