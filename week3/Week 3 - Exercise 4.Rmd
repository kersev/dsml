**Exercise: Introduction to outliers**

An outlier is a number that is very different to the other numbers, for
example, if most people in a test scored somewhere between 40% and 50%
but there were two people that scored 100% - then you might consider the
100% scores as outliers.

In some way, you might consider the terms outlier and anomalous as
similar concepts.

There are different ways to identify outliers in a variable.

You can use the standardisation approach where you might assess the
z-scores.

**Consider the following variable that stores the heart rates of 500
people. Copy, paste and store this vector in R.**

77, 95, 60, 88, 72, 87, 66, 98)

**Convert this vector to z-scores using standardisation:**

standardUnits \<- scale(heartRates)

**You can now run the summary function to see that the mean is now 0
indicating that the values have been standardised.**

summary(standardUnits)

![A close-up of a number AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image1.png){width="2.0833333333333335in"
height="1.625in"}

The max already perhaps indicates that there is an outlier (i.e. 3.1746
SDs above the mean is a relatively very high number).

**You can convert all negative numbers to positive numbers using the
abs() function:**

absoluteStandardUnits \<- abs(standardUnits)

This means that you can no longer determine if a number is above or
below the mean, but this will allow us to count the number of outliers
regardless if the numbers are very low numbers or very high numbers
(e.g. regardless if the numbers are 3 standard deviations below the mean
or 3 standard deviations above the mean).

You will know from the normal curve
(<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Standard_deviation_diagram_micro.svg>)
that we may expect **5%** of the numbers to be more than 1.96 standard
deviations (SDs) above or below the mean. In other words, 95% of numbers
can be expected to be within 1.96 SDs above or below the mean.

**Use this code to count the number of outliers according to our
threshold of 1.96.**

> outliers \<- absoluteStandardUnits\[absoluteStandardUnits \>= 1.96\]
>
> length(outliers)

The result should be 15.

Hence, there are 15 out of 500 heart rate values that are 1.96 SDs above
or below the mean.

15/500 is 0.03 or 3%. Hence, we have fewer 'outliers' than perhaps we
expected according to the normal curve (i.e. 3% vs. the expected 5%).

Feel free to change the threshold to identify more extreme outliers.

e.g.,

> outliers \<- absoluteStandardUnits\[absoluteStandardUnits \>= 3\]
>
> length(outliers)

**Now boxplot the heartRates vector:**

boxplot(heartRates,main=\"Heart Rates\")

![A graph with a line and a rectangle AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image2.png){width="3.2063713910761154in"
height="2.9079418197725286in"}

Study the following annotated diagram showing how to read boxplots:

![A diagram of a heart rate AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image3.png){width="6.5in"
height="3.522222222222222in"}

Boxplots use a different approach to determine outliers.

When using boxplots, an outlier is considered any value that is above
the following threshold:

75^th^ percentile + (IQR\*1.5)

or any value that is below the following threshold:

25^th^ percentile - (IQR\*1.5)

IQR stands for interquartile range (IQR).

If you enlarge the boxplot, you can see 3 outliers being presented:

![A white rectangular object with black dots AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image4.png){width="3.8472222222222223in"
height="1.7916666666666667in"}

**Here we can do the manual calculations.**

According to:

summary(heartRates)

the 75^th^ percentile is 94.00.

And according to:

IQR(heartRates)

the interquartile range is 27.

So the boxplot method is using the following formula to determine high
outliers.

94.00 + (27\*1.5)

Which is 134.5.

**So now we can use 134.5 to count the number of high outliers using the
following code:**

> outliers \<- heartRates\[heartRates \>= 134.5\]
>
> length(outliers)

This returns the number 3, which matches the number of high outliers
that are visualised on the boxplot.

You can now calculate and see if there are low outliers but we can see
from the boxplot that there are none. However, have a go and do the
manual calculation to determine if there are any low numbers that are
considered outliers using the following formula.

25^th^ percentile - (IQR\*1.5)

Usefully, R allows you to access the raw numbers that the boxplot
function classified as outliers.

The following code allows you to do this:

> x \<- boxplot(heartRates,main=\"Heart Rates\")
>
> x\$out

You will see the numbers that the boxplot considered as outliers:

> 138
>
> 137
>
> 139
